# micro-git
## Project Goal
This project is my attempt at making a small clone of git and getting the hang of golang.

**Note:** This project is not meant to be a replacement for git in any way. If you are looking for an alternative, feel free to check out [go-git](https://github.com/go-git/go-git).
